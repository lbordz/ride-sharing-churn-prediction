# Case Study: Predicting Churn for Ride Sharing Company


## Context
The goal of this project was to help a ride-sharing company understand what factors are the best predictors for customer retention, and offer suggestions on how to improve retention.


## Data
The data for this project was obtained from a real ride-sharing company based in San Francisco.

A user is considered "active" if they look a trip in the preceeding 30 days. Otherwise, the ride-sharing company considers the user to have churned.

The data I have access to is:  
 - `city`: city this user signed up in 
 - `phone`: primary device for this user
 - `signup_date`: date of account registration
 - `last_trip_date`: the last time this user completed a trip
 - `avg_dist`: the average distance (in miles) per trip taken in the first 30 days after signup
 - `avg_rating_by_driver`: the rider’s average rating over all of their trips
 - `avg_rating_of_driver`: the rider’s average rating of their drivers over all of their trips
 - `high_demand_pricing`: the percent of trips taken when pricing was higher due to high demand
 - `avg_demand`: The percent of trips taken during high-demand times
 - `trips_in_first_30_days`: the number of trips this user took in the first 30 days after signing up
 - `luxury_car_user`: TRUE if the user took a luxury car in their first 30 days
 - `weekday_pct`: the percent of the user’s trips occurring during a weekday

## Data Cleaning
