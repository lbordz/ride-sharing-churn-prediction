# Case Study: Predicting Churn for Ride Sharing Company


## Context
The goal of this project was to help a ride-sharing company understand what factors are the best predictors for customer retention, and offer suggestions on how to improve retention.


## Data
The data for this project was obtained from a real ride-sharing company based in San Francisco.

A user is considered "active" if they look a trip in the preceeding 30 days. Otherwise, the ride-sharing company considers the user to have churned.


## Data Cleaning


## Exploratory analysis (What did I preliminarily find?)
